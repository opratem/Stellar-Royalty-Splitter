    // calculators with no notion of "which NFT, tracked over time" — neither

    // counter and a first-seen timestamp), so it lives in a new function,
    // `record_tiered_secondary_sale`, following the same "add a new,
    // more-specific entry point rather than changing an existing one's
    // signature" precedent `record_nft_secondary_sale` itself already set
    // when #933 needed a `token_id` that `record_secondary_sale` doesn't take.
    //
    // Rate resolution for a sale of `nft_id` under `rarity`:
    //   1. Look up the tier matching `rarity` (admin-configured via
    //      `set_royalty_tiers`) → `tier.rate_bps`. Errors if no such tier.
    //   2. Increment (or initialize, first time this (token, nft_id) is
    //      seen) the resale count and first-seen timestamp for `nft_id`.
    //   3. Apply resale-count degradation to `tier.rate_bps`:
    //        count == 1        → 100% of tier.rate_bps (full rate)
    //        count in [2, 3]   → 50%  of tier.rate_bps
    //        count >= 4        → 25%  of tier.rate_bps
    //   4. If the NFT is older than `TIER_TIME_DEGRADE_AGE_SECS` (90 days)
    //      at the time of this sale, apply a further `TIER_TIME_DEGRADE_BPS`
    //      (50%) reduction ON TOP of step 3's result — i.e. the two
    //      degradations COMPOUND MULTIPLICATIVELY, resale-count first, then
    //      time-based. Worked example: tier rate 1000 bps, 5th resale
    //      (>= 4 ⇒ 25%) of a 100-day-old NFT (> 90 days ⇒ further 50%):
    //      1000 × 0.25 × 0.50 = 125 bps. This compounding order (rather than
    //      additive, or time-first) is a judgment call documented here
    //      because the issue text specifies the resale-count percentages
    //      exactly but leaves both the time-based percentage and the
    //      compounding order/model unspecified.

    // them at any given moment. It does NOT change their `share` in
    // `ShareMap`/`Recipient` — the payout math in `calculate_payouts` (which
    // every conservation invariant in the fuzz/property test suites depends
    // on) still computes each recipient's full nominal payout, so the

    // leaves the rest as a per-token pending balance the beneficiary can pull
    // later via `claim_vested_shares` as more of their schedule vests. A

    // behavior as before #931.
